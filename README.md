<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wind energy is a crucial component of the renewable energy sector, a clean source of power that harnesses the movement of air (converting the kinetic energy of air in motion) to produce sustainable electricity sources or to power up machinery. The wind causes the wind turbines' blades to rotate and the rotational energy is transferred by a shaft which to the generator, thus producing electrical energy.

Consequently, wind power is inexhaustible. As long as the wind blows, electricity can be generated without depleting any resources / causing any environmental degradation, such as humans' dependency on fossil fuels and coals to produce energy. However, wind blows are not consistent, leading to fluctuations in power generation, a poor substitute for fossil fuels, or more power renewable energy like solar energy. Due to such uncertainty, a monitoring system and a set of measuring instruments are adapted in wind farms to provide critical operation, management, and maintenance-related data to determine the efficiency and productivity of wind turbines.

SCADA - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system offers full remote control through a centralized computer and communicates commonly via optical fibers to support the supervision of the wind parks as a whole, individual wind turbines' behavior, substations & meteorological stations. It keeps records of all aforementioned activities on a 10-minute basis and allows operators to determine the corrective action to be taken when required. The SCADA system has to implement any requirements in the connection agreement such as:
<ul>
  <li>To control reactive power production</li>
  <li>To contribute to network voltage/frequency control</li>
  <li>To limit power output in response to instructions from network operator</li>
</ul>

Additionally, investment in meteorological instruments e.g. anemometer, installed at the top of wind turbines measures and collects wind speed and direction data (alternative tool: wind vanes). Wind energy instruments are critical in renewable power plant operations with several justifications:
<ul>
  <li>To ensure the efficiency, reliability, and safety of the wind power generation process through the provision of accurate, real-time data.</li>
  <li>Enable operators to monitor and control the performances and power output of wind turbines.</li>
  <li>Minimizing downtime through spotting minor potential problems before they exacerbate and lead to catastrophic events such as disturbances to the power supply.</li>
</ul>
</p>
  
<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>To forecast the wind turbine power generation, to reduce the likelihood of electricity downtime incidents while simultaneously promoting environmental sustainability.</p>

<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>It is the contiguous observations and parameters related to wind turbines in Turkey throughout 2018, recorded in SCADA.</p>
